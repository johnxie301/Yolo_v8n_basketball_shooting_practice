What it can do now: 
- shot accuracy
- Identify actions on the court

## Problem
By importing both a video of a player's shooting motion and a video of the user, my model analyzes key basketball shooting features and returns suggestions on adjustments in details. 
It records angles, ball trajectories during critical frames, shooting time, and the overall accuracy, offering detailed insights to improve performance.
