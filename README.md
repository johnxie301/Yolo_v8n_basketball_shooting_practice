The  ultimate goal is to create an app that is able to give suggestions to users on shooting forms. * Shoot the shot like your favorite NBA player 
What it can do now: 
- shot accuracy
- Identify actions on the court
- Trajectories of the ball
- Pose detection
- Bending angles of elbows and knees.

## Problem
By importing both a video of a player's shooting motion and a video of the user, my model analyzes key basketball shooting features and returns suggestions on adjustments in details. 
It records angles, ball trajectories during critical frames, shooting time, and the overall accuracy, offering detailed insights to improve performance.
